# 🔐 Secure Web Deployment & SSL/TLS Hardening

Deployed and secured an Apache web server with HTTPS, focusing on SSL/TLS configuration hardening and vulnerability analysis. Evaluated encryption strength and protocol security to ensure compliance with modern web security standards.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Web Server**: Apache HTTP Server  
- **Security**: OpenSSL, SSL/TLS  
- **Assessment Tools**: Qualys SSL Labs  

---

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

- Configured HTTPS using OpenSSL with secure certificate generation and key management  
- Hardened SSL/TLS protocols and cipher suites to mitigate weak encryption risks  
- Disabled deprecated protocols and insecure cipher configurations  

---

## 🔍 Security Analysis & Validation

- Analyzed server security posture using Qualys SSL Labs  
- Identified and remediated SSL/TLS misconfigurations  
- Improved server security rating through iterative hardening  

---

## 🔁 How to Reproduce (Lab Setup)

1. Provisioned an Ubuntu Linux VM and installed Apache HTTP Server.
2. Generated SSL certificates using OpenSSL and configured HTTPS on Apache.
3. Hardened SSL/TLS configuration by disabling weak protocols and cipher suites.
4. Validated server security posture using Qualys SSL Labs scans.
5. Reviewed scan results and applied configuration improvements to achieve stronger security ratings.

**Result:** Achieved improved SSL/TLS security posture through iterative configuration hardening.
